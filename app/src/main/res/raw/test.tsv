id1&&Oxy SJP and Oxy JVP stage encampment for Palestine, plan to stay ‘as long as possible’&&Ava Lalonde&&240430&&test, exam, final&&April 29, 4 a.m., Occidental Students for Justice in Palestine (Oxy SJP) and Occidental Jewish Voice for Peace (Oxy JVP) assembled an encampment of 17 tents on the Academic Quad, below the steps of the Arthur G. Coons Administrative Building, to show solidarity with Palestinians against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the conflict in Gaza. Oxy SJP announced the encampment on their Instagram around 7 a.m., encouraging people to join. By 3:15 p.m., the encampment had grown to 38 tents.\n\n\n\nOxy SJP spokesperson Matthew Vickers (junior) said that there were roughly 40 people at the encampment all day, with a peak of 70-80 people midday. Vickers, who was featured on the April 29 episode of NPR’s “Consider This,” said the timeline for the encampment is indefinite and the plan is to stay as long as possible.\n\n\n\nAccording to a banner at the encampment site, the encampment has three demands for Occidental’s administration — recognition of the Israeli occupation of Gaza as a genocide and a call for a ceasefire, full amnesty for all students and faculty protesting for Palestine and disclosure and divestment from companies Lockheed Martin, Elbit, Boeing and Caterpillar.\n\n\n\nAccording to Vickers, Oxy SJP delivered a memorandum titled “Divestment Proposal for Consideration of the Financial Committee of the Board of Trustees” to Occidental’s Chief Operating Officer Amos Himmelstein April 25. The memorandum discusses Boeing, Elbit, Lockheed Martin and Caterpillar’s “involvement and direct ties to war crimes against civilians,” asks the college to investigate if it is invested in these companies and, if so, to divest from them.\n\n\n\nAfter 4 p.m. April 29, the Oxy SJP executive board received an email from the Board of Trustees Investment Committee (IC) Chair, Ronald Hahn, responding to their divestment proposal. According to Hahn’s email, the college’s investment advisor confirmed that the college is invested in all four companies through several third-party mutual fund managers.\n\n\n\n“Virtually all of College’s investment assets (the Fund) are managed by third parties who manage pooled funds for the benefit of a number of investors, and, within their own investment guidelines, individual managers have significant discretion regarding how funds under their management are invested,” Hahn said via email to the SJP.\n\n\n\nAccording to Hahn’s email, the IC will “convene to review the proposal and make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees regarding SJP’s proposal to cease any future investment in these companies. The Board of Trustees will then vote on the IC’s recommendation at their next scheduled meeting before issuing a formal statement.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Vickers, the next Board of Trustees meeting is scheduled for the Fall, but Oxy SJP is hoping to convene an emergency meeting before then to hold a vote on divestment.\n\n\n\nVickers said that the encampment is meant to highlight and center Gaza.\n\n\n\n“A lot of the coverage about the student movement has sadly overshadowed some of the most egregious things that happened so far in the war, such as the discovery of 300 bodies at Nasser […] Hospital,” Vickers said.\n\n\n\nIn response to the encampment, President Harry Elam sent out a campus-wide email at 11:54 a.m., stating that any dialogue or demonstration should remain safe and peaceful.\n\n\n\n“One of Occidental’s highest purposes is to empower our community to learn to engage in society and advocate for their positions in a manner that moves difficult dialogues forward, regardless of the issue,” Elam wrote.\n\n\n\nThe encampment hosted programming events throughout the day, including teach-in demonstrations from community organizations such as Queers for Palestine, Labor for Palestine and others focused on genocide and interrelated topics, Vickers said.\n\n\n\nA participant in the encampment who has attended previous Oxy SJP events said they had been at the encampment all day, only leaving to attend class. The participant, who will remain anonymous to protect their identity, said that their professors were supportive of the encampment and dismissed them from class early.\n\n\n\n“It is really scary how much the U.S. contributes to the genocide in Gaza and how much repression students have been facing recently for speaking out and for protesting,” the participant said. “Showing that we have each other’s backs and that we’re going to support especially our Muslim and Palestinian students on campus is really important to me.”\n\n\n\nThe participant said they were planning to sleep over at the encampment. According to the participant, the encampment’s goal is to tell the college that its investments do not align with the core values of the college or its student body.\n\n\n\nThe participant said that demonstrators have been participating in a variety of activities throughout the day.\n\n\n\n“That’s a pretty dominant narrative,” the participant said. “That these on-campus student protests are hateful or antisemitic in some way, and that’s really unfair to all of the Jewish students that are out here today, leading and supporting.”\n\n\n\nThis is a continuing story and The Occidental will continue to report online.\n\n\n\nContact Ava LaLonde at lalonde@oxy.edu and James Miller at jmiller4@oxy.edu
id2&&Oxy SJP holds Tax Day walkout and demonstration, continues calls for administrative action&&Avinash Iyer&&240423&&poc,english&& April 15, Occidental Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) held a walkout and march to protest against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Oxy SJP said the event was spurred by a call to strike from the Palestinian Youth Movement, a transnational youth organization for Palestinian liberation from Israeli rule.\n\n\n\nApril 15 is Tax Day in the U.S., the final date to file tax returns. The Oxy SJP spokesperson also said holding the event on Tax Day was an intentional choice to protest against the American government funding that seems to prolong the conflict.\n\n\n\n“We chose the day also, symbolically, because it’s Tax Day,” the Oxy SJP spokesperson said. “Seventy percent of the arms to Israel, billions of dollars [are] flowing to the country thanks to US taxpayers.”\n\n\n\nThe walkout and march started around 11:30 a.m. on the steps leading to the Arthur G. Coons Administrative Center. A crowd of a little more than 40 students began gathering by the side entrance of Johnson Hall. A long banner was placed on the steps listing the names of Palestinian children under 5 years old killed by recent bombing in Gaza. By 11:50 a.m., a little more than 60 students had assembled by the steps.\n\n\n\nAt 11:55 a.m., an Oxy SJP member spoke to a crowd of what became around 80 students and faculty members.\n\n\n\nIn their speech, the Oxy SJP speaker said the conflict has now reached genocidal levels.\n\n\n\n“Today is a literal representation of funding of the Palestinian genocide,” Oxy SJP speaker said.\n\n\n\nThe speaker said that Oxy SJP is continuing to call for Occidental to divest from companies associated with the Israeli state. According to them, Occidental has a history of divestment from companies on ethical and environmental grounds.\n\n\n\n“In 2012 to 2014, Oxy’s Board of Trustees divested from military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines after the Sandy Hook massacre,” the Oxy SJP Speaker said. “Two years ago in 2022, Oxy divested and promised not to invest in fossil fuels.”\n\n\n\nHowever, the Oxy SJP speaker said that when it comes to companies tied to the Israeli state, Occidental seems resistant and even hostile to calls for divestment.\n\n\n\n“In 2019, when SJP, along with faculty, students and staff, demanded that Oxy’s Board of Trustees divest from companies that funded the state of Israel, not only did the Board of Trustees reject this divestment attempt, but SJP members were doxxed for this action,” the Oxy SJP speaker said.\n\n\n\nOccidental College’s director of communications, Rachael Warecki, said via email that the College gave Oxy SJP formal procedures for proposing divestment following Oxy SJP’s overnight occupation of the AGC back in November.\n\n\n\n“The College has a process through which student, faculty, or staff groups can submit proposals related to the College’s investment practices,” Warecki said. “Following the campus political activity earlier this academic year, that process was shared with students from the Occidental SJP chapter.”\n\n\n\nHowever, she said that the administration has not received any new formal divestment requests since its earlier discussion with Oxy SJP but is open to providing answers on how to formally proceed with a request.\n\n\n\n“Since then, the College has not received a proposal on this topic,” Warecki said. “Administrators have made themselves available to answer any questions that student groups may have about the process, and will continue to do so.”\n\n\n\nThe Oxy SJP speaker said this resistance is indicative of an immoral apathy toward certain minority interests.\n\n\n\n“It tells us that when it comes to Black and Indigenous Palestinian lives, Oxy refuses to acknowledge their humanity and continues in apartheid and genocide and is more than complicit in murdering innocent people of color,” the Oxy SJP speaker said. “That’s shameful.”\n\n\n\nAccording to the Oxy SJP speaker, the event is a part of the broader student activist movement for Palestinian independence that is being suppressed. They said nearby developments at Pomona College are exemplifying this suppression.\n\n\n\n“Look at Pomona College and [Pomona College President] Gabi Starr arresting 20 students by riot gear who are occupying and demanding divestment from genocide,” the Oxy SJP speaker said.\n\n\n\nThe Oxy SJP speaker said that the movement advocates for the Palestinian cause regardless and that the walkout and march continue the call for ceasefire and divestment.\n\n\n\n“In spite of all of this, we students speak for ourselves,” the Oxy SJP speaker said. “We have to speak for ourselves against the silencing of pro-Palestinian movement for a ceasefire statement and for divestment.”\n\n\n\nAfter their speech, the speaker led students on a march circling twice around the Academic Quad, with two students holding the flag of Palestine at the front. Students chanted slogans such as “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “Your profits are covered in Palestinian blood.”\n\n\n\nAfter marching around the Academic Quad, the students walked inside the AGC, where two speakers from Stop LAPD Spying, an organization opposed to police surveillance, spoke to the crowd.\n\n\n\n“History books will be written about what you all are doing here today,” the first Stop LAPD Spying speaker said. “And it’s scaring the s**t out of the people in power.”\n\n\n\nAccording to the first Stop LAPD Spying speaker, both Democrats and Republicans have put forth bills aimed at shutting down pro-Palestine demonstrations, and demonstrations are often not supported by members of administrations.\n\n\n\n“We see the way that the police are attacking SJP students in Claremont. We see the way that Canary Mission lists people’s faces, especially targeting Muslim, Black, Arab and other people of color youth to try to make them unemployable,” the first Stop LAPD Spying speaker said.\n\n\n\nThe first Stop LAPD Spying speaker said that they are opposed to the concept of a two-state solution.\n\n\n\n“F**k all that, what we have to do is get rid of Zionism,” the first Stop LAPD Spying speaker said. “We know that Zionism is not just an issue that is important to people in Palestine; it’s integrally tied to all the white supremacist policing here.”\n\n\n\nAccording to the second speaker, the struggle for Palestine and Stop LAPD Spying’s opposition to police surveillance are the same battle.\n\n\n\n“We’re not merely here as supporters, right? We are involved in the same quest for liberation,” the second Stop LAPD Spying speaker said.\n\n\n\nAt around 12:10 p.m., the second speaker led students on a closing chant denouncing what they see as white supremacism ingrained in institutional forces of government: “LAPD, KKK, IDF, they’re all the same.” The event ended by 12:20 p.m., as students cheered and dispersed from the AGC.\n\n\n\nContact Noah Kim at nkim4@oxy.edu and Avinash Iyer at iyera@oxy.edu.
id3&&Indigo De Souza headlines SpringFest, closing out Spirit Week&&Nora Youngelson&&2404234&&math,science&&Strobe lights illuminated Rush Gymnasium April 13 as three acts took the stage for the annual Springfest. This year the headliner was Indigo De Souza — an Indie Rock artist — and the show featured two student openers: Alyssa Player (senior), with her accompanying band, and the Indie band Spirit Foul.\n\n\n\nDe Souza performed an arrangement of songs from her albums “I Love My Mom” and “All of This Will End.” She also played two unreleased songs for the crowd of students.\n\n\n\nOccidental Programming Board Co-Managers Sophie Weil (junior) and Teo Lennertz (junior) said that their team has been planning SpringFest since the early Fall semester. According to Programming Board’s club advisor Steve Eulenberg, the choice for this year’s headliner was made by the student community.\n\n\n\n“I had the students reach out and do a survey of the community to find specific artists that they were looking for,” Eulenberg said. “With that data, I helped the students go through and identify both artists that were recommended and were requested while also looking at genres.”\n\n\n\nWith the survey information, Weil said the team landed on De Souza, the 26-year-old artist from North Carolina.\n\n\n\nIn addition to SpringFest, Lennertz said that Programming Board wanted to do something a little different this year, so they decided to create Spirit Week.\n\n\n\n“This is our first Spirit Week ever,” Lennertz said. “Every day from Monday to Friday leading up to SpringFest we have partnered with a different organization or [have] hosted an event ourselves. We wanted to make SpringFest an even bigger event than it has been in previous years, especially since we haven’t had FallFest this year. We really wanted to make this whole week something special for the school.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Eulenberg, Spirit Week included events such as a magic show, an open mic night and a DJ set of student artists. Eulenberg said that he hoped this week would contribute to the campus community.\n\n\n\n“I am hoping to build school spirit and tradition, I think that is really important,” Eulenberg said. “And then working with the larger LA music scene and being able to provide students with an experience here on campus that’s kind of reflective of the robust music scene here in LA.”\n\n\n\nWeil said that Occidental’s community comes together around music, and it was important to Programming Board that student artists open for De Souza.\n\n\n\n“It is a really big deal for the student bands to open and have that opportunity,” Weil said. “They get really excited, and that also draws [in] a bunch of their friends who are excited. We really want to keep supporting the student musicians here as much as possible, especially since the music community here has grown so much recently.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Weil, Programming Board chose the two openers, Alyssa Player and Spirit Foul, after receiving submissions from many student artists.\n\n\n\nSpirit Foul guitarist Eli Kramer (junior) said that it was an amazing experience for the band to be able to open at SpringFest.\n\n\n\n“It was fun because a lot of us hadn’t played on a pro set up before,” Kramer said. “So it was fun to get a chance to hear ourselves with professional sound. And we practiced a lot more than normal, so the couple of weeks before we were gearing up and that was a lot of fun.”\n\n\n\nWeil said that Programming Board intended to host SpringFest in Remsen Bird Hillside Theater. Due to forecasted rain, however, the Programming Board announced via email April 11 that SpringFest would be moved to Rush Gymnasium. Rush Gymnasium was then quickly converted into a stage, complete with lighting and free refreshments provided by Yerba Mate.\n\n\n\n“Honestly, the space was cool,” Kramer said. “I think they did a good job of making the gym feel like a different space.”\n\n\n\nWith the basketball nets lifted up to make room for the stage, Player opened up the night with originals from her album “Ice Cream Trucks,” supported by band members Lucas Donovan (junior), Matan Birnbaum (junior) and Luca Nisimblat (sophomore).\n\n\n\nFollowing Player, Spirit Foul — a band made up of students Kramer, Lily Pesikoff (sophomore), Nate Pitroff (sophomore) and Soren Covell (sophomore) — played mostly originals, alternating between main vocalists.\n\n\n\nAfter the student openers, headliner De Souza took the stage, playing many of her top hits. During her song “Younger & Dumber,” the audience took out their phone flashlights.\n\n\n\nAccording to Weil, at the end of the day SpringFest is an event for the students, and the Programming Board wanted to create an event that reflected and uplifted the campus community.\n\n\n\n“SpringFest is a super communal, fun and different event,” Weil said. “Every year we are able to make the choice of keeping it free for all the students. That’s a big thing that we will keep doing just to be able to give access to the community.”\n\n\n\nContact Nora Youngelson at youngelson@oxy.edu.
id4&&Writing and Rhetoric Department becomes “College Writing Program”&&Noah Kim&&240410&&tag&&As students and faculty perused the Course Counts website during course registration, the attentive browser might have noticed a change: the disappearance of the Writing and Rhetoric Department (WRD). If they looked further, they might have even seen the appearance of a new subject, titled “College Writing Program.”\n\n\n\nThese changes are no programming errors. Writing Program Director and American Studies department chair Julie Prebel said that last year, the Writing and Rhetoric Department was decommissioned by a faculty vote.\n\n\n\n“Last year, led by the Dean of the College and Academic Planning Committee (APC), the Writing and Rhetoric Department, as a department, was decommissioned,” Prebel said.\n\n\n\nHowever, Prebel said the now-decommissioned WRD has been replaced by the new College Writing Program (CWP). According to her, the CWP’s curriculum is the exact same as that of the old WRD.\n\n\n\n“The curriculum that [lived] in the department is unchanged,” Prebel said. “There’s no change to the courses, there’s still the same courses being offered, the same number of courses being offered.”\n\n\n\nAssociate Dean for Curricular Affairs and computer science professor Kathryn Leonard said via email that the faculty vote count for decommissioning the WRD was not highly contested — more than 2/3 of the faculty voted to dissolve, according to Leonard.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Leonard said that all faculty working in the WRD will retain their positions in the CWP.\n\n\n\n“All the [Non-Tenure Track] NTT faculty who were part of WRD are now part of CWP,” Leonard said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Leonard, the name change is part of an effort to standardize the titles of academic subjects at the college.\n\n\n\n“The change brought what was actually happening on campus in line with the campus policies about what constitutes an academic department,” Leonard said.\n\n\n\nLeonard said the difference between a department and a program is in their degree offerings and faculty size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“A department has typically at least three tenure track faculty members and a major,” Leonard said. “A program is a smaller structure — it may not have any faculty members assigned full time to it, or it may not have a major.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Leonard, it had been unusual to classify WRD as a department, as it lacked the characteristics of an academic department.\n\n\n\n“WRD was a department with no major, no minor, and no tenure track faculty,” Leonard said. “In other words, none of the elements that typically make up an academic department.”\n\n\n\nPrebel said the Dean and the APC were the authors of the new title, “College Writing Program.” According to her, the loss of the word “Rhetoric” in the title is only a surface-level change, reemphasizing that the CWP retains all WRD courses, including those focused on rhetoric.\n\n\n\n“We’ve got these courses that we really designed to have more of a focus, also, on rhetoric and the study of rhetoric,” Prebel said. “Those courses are still in [the] CWP.”\n\n\n\nLeonard said she hopes emphasizing the word “Writing” will also foreground writing education at the college.\n\n\n\n“I hope the change will elevate the visibility of writing on campus,” Leonard said. “The name College Writing Program is an invitation to the campus community.”\n\n\n\nPrebel said the change will largely not affect faculty, thanks to union protections.\n\n\n\n“The faculty teaching in [the] CWP are presently all NTT faculty, and NTT faculty are unionized,” Prebel said. “So there cannot be workload changes.”\n\n\n\nCWP Professor Anita Zachary teaches WRD 201, now CWP 201, which is required for sophomores who have yet to pass their First-Stage Writing Requirement. She said via email that the change will not affect the way she teaches the course.\n\n\n\nZachary said the only possible change the new designation could bring about to students is an expansion of writing opportunities later down the line.\n\n\n\n“Students shouldn’t feel any impact,” Zachary said. “If anything, the designation as a program may expand opportunities for students such as maybe new offerings or perhaps engagements with the writing community here in Los Angeles.”\n\n\n\nHowever, Leonard said that, for the time being, the change should not affect students in any way and that there are currently no plans to modify the size of the program.\n\n\n\nPrebel said she is a bit sad to see the “WRD” acronym go, as the shorthand was a convenient phonetic spelling of “word.”\n\n\n\n“I think a lot of us like WRD, which we shorthand as ‘word,’” Prebel said. “Which kind of works with the particular field of study.”\n\n\n\nStill, she said the change remains mostly a nominal one.\n\n\n\n“Again, the courses are still the same,” Prebel said. “And the descriptions of the courses are the same as they were before too. It’s just that there’s the new ‘CWP’ in front of them.”\n\n\n\nContact Noah Kim at nkim4@oxy.edu
id5&&COVID-19’s class of 2024 spent their first year of college online; eleven seniors said they took it in stride&&Mia Anzalone&&240410&&tag&&Occidental’s class of 2024 may be graduating together in May, but just over four years ago, they were dispersed around the world individually, celebrating what seemed to be a one to two-week extension of spring break.\n\n\n\nKyle Ahn (senior), from Rancho Palos Verdes, CA, remembered his high school sent the fateful email March 12, 2020 and was initially excited for the more time off.\n\n\n\n“I had a bunch of tests coming up and I was like, ‘I don’t have to do them,’” Ahn said.\n\n\n\nAt that time, Isac Benyam-Desbel (senior) said he was attending a high school with an International Baccalaureate (IB) program, whose headquarters are in Switzerland.\n\n\n\n“When a bunch of other IB schools around the world started shutting down, especially in Italy or in other parts of Europe, I remember there was a big push to get our version of the AP exam canceled because we were like, ‘They can’t take scores right now because half the world and all of Europe was shut down right now,’” Benyam-Desbel said.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, COVID-19 arrived in the U.S. and patient zero just happened to be from King County, WA, where Hannah Christensen (senior) was going to high school. She said she anticipated her school to shut down because schools around the county began to do so.\n\n\n\n“I was literally in AP Gov, sixth period, when the announcement came on,” Christensen said. “We all kind of saw it coming, but at that point, everyone was expecting to come back by mid-April.”\n\n\n\nCome April, the break kept going. And going. The class of 2020 never returned to their high schools, at least for any in-person instruction.\n\n\n\nSchools began canceling proms and in-person graduation ceremonies, Amanda Iglesias (senior), from Acton, MA, said.\n\n\n\n“They said school was closed for the rest of the year — I did cry about it,” Iglesias said. “It felt really weird, it all felt really fake.”\n\n\n\nInstead, high schools adapted to drive-by graduations and final farewells to teachers from their parents’ cars’ sunroofs.\n\n\n\nThe drive-by graduations were memorable, to say the least, but maybe not in the way Noel Lee (senior)* from Glendale, CA, would like to remember.\n\n\n\n“It was like drive by, get diploma, drive by, walk the podium with a mask, drive by, get a photo,” Noel Lee said. “I closed my eyes and they didn’t do the retake.”\n\n\n\nBenyam-Desbel said he enjoyed his high school graduation, though. One high school alumni’s parents owned an old-fashioned drive-in movie theater, where Benyam-Desbel and his friends watched pre-recorded videos of their class receiving their high school diplomas.\n\n\n\n“We all parked our cars, we all crowded into my car, all screaming and yelling and stuff because there were no rules,” Benyam-Desbel said. “It was just a fun graduation, actually. And my brother graduated a few years later and that was so boring.”\n\n\n\nAhn said he was invited to speak at his class’ graduation, but instead of speaking to 500 of his classmates, he had to pre-record a speech in front of a cameraman and his principal.\n\n\n\nAhn’s graduation came amid the social reckoning after the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd, which not only impacted his speech to his classmates, but his outlook on his future at the time.\n\n\n\n“I tried to make people feel like there was hope in the future because at the time, everything felt so hopeless and so apocalyptic, but I didn’t want to make people feel that way when we’re supposed to be celebrating, right?” Ahn said. “When we’re supposed to be moving on to new chapters in our lives.”\n\n\n\nGieselle Gatewood (senior), from Chino, CA, said that despite the strange high school send-off, her unique graduation was the least of her concerns.\n\n\n\n“At that time, I was like, ‘Okay, my graduation probably isn’t the biggest thing’ because I had older family members, you know? We all had people who were more susceptible to COVID, so it’s like graduation, ‘whatever,’” Gatewood said. “I also was just so ready to go to college.”\n\n\n\nDaniel Lee (senior), from La Crescenta, CA, said COVID-19 started to feel real when his mom, who runs a dry-cleaning business in Simi Valley, and his dad, who worked at a sushi shop, both lost their jobs.\n\n\n\n“They weren’t out of business for more than a month, but they did spend a good amount of time at home and they were pretty stressed out,” Daniel Lee said.\n\n\n\nWhen both returned to work, Daniel Lee said he was worried that both of his parents would catch COVID-19.\n\n\n\n“For my mom specifically, you’re getting clothes that were being worn, so we’d be like, ‘Be careful, wear a mask,” Daniel Lee said. “It was really scary. That’s when I felt like it was really affecting the world.”\n\n\n\nThroughout the end of high school, Ahn worked at a Mediterranean restaurant and said he was considered an essential worker. Out of four members of his family, including his parents, he became the only Ahn working, sometimes taking on a full eight-hour shift while juggling schoolwork.\n\n\n\n“It was probably one of the most depressing times of my life because I would drive to work and there would not be a single car on the road,” Ahn said. “There would usually be a slump of traffic and that time of year, it was pretty rainy and empty streets — it was just me and my mom’s minivan.”\n\n\n\nFor many seniors from California who were interviewed, Occidental quickly became a top-choice college over a list of bigger universities and other liberal arts colleges primarily due to an attractive financial aid package and the appeal of staying in the state amid a global pandemic. That was the case for Bay Area resident Pooja Bansiya (senior) who initially wanted to attend the University of California Santa Barbara and the University of Washington.\n\n\n\n“The pandemic made it difficult to visit schools because I wanted to see Oxy and I wanted to see what it was actually like. I eventually did come on a trip here with my dad and we saw campus by itself, but it felt so weird to do so because we were just looking literally at how it looked — it was totally empty,” Bansiya said. “I don’t think they had anybody here during that summer, so I chose Oxy on a whim.”\n\n\n\nBy July 15, 2020, President Harry Elam announced in a campus-wide email that classes would be conducted remotely and housing would only be offered to international students and those in dire situations.\n\n\n\nCiara Gillen (senior), who is from Newton, MA, was intent on moving to California after graduating high school and said she was excited about what college had to offer.\n\n\n\n“I was excited to move across the country, live in a dorm with a new roommate and see what communal living was like,” Gillen said. “Oxy had such a good reputation for their food at the time like I just wanted to go to the dining hall.”\n\n\n\nGillen said she was not surprised about the college’s decision to go remote for at least the Fall semester.\n\n\n\n“I think I was trying to hold that hope that we would be in person, but I felt like I knew the odds were so low,” Gillen said. “Especially with Oxy being in Los Angeles, I knew it was so bad here and so when we got the email, I wasn’t super surprised.”\n\n\n\nBeyam Desbel said he felt hopeful when the college announced that remote instruction would only be for a semester initially.\n\n\n\n“I thought to myself, if I’m going to stay home I’d rather just do something else, work or take a gap year,” Benyam-Desbel said.\n\n\n\nTaking a gap year crossed other seniors’ minds including Gatewood’s, who ultimately decided to leap into college based on financial reasons. Without having to pay for her room and board, Gatewood said it was an easy decision to enroll immediately.\n\n\n\n“It was a pretty easy decision for me to just be like, ‘Okay, one year on Zoom,’ if we had to do a second year on Zoom, maybe I would do a gap year, but it was like yes, this sucks, but I’m saving a lot of money,” Gatewood said.\n\n\n\nThe majority of the class of 2024 subsequently spent Fall 2020 in the nooks and crannies of cramped apartments or locked in their childhood bedrooms. Arelí Fernandez Orozco (senior), who is from Pasadena, CA wrestled with a preteen brother, a teenage sister and an older brother working from home during Fall 2020.\n\n\n\n“They would get annoyed with me because I’d be in Glee Club singing and they’d be like, ‘Shut up! You’re being so annoying’ and I’d be like, ‘I’m sorry!’” Fernandez said. “My little brother definitely loved causing chaos and mayhem in the back of my Zoom recording — he would just walk by or just do silly things or just wait till I was unmuted to say some random stuff. It had me really on edge, but it made things exciting. I look back on it now, and it was nice to have people that brought some excitement, however small, to Zoom life.”\n\n\n\nOthers’ setup was quieter. Josue Corona Solis (senior) said he spent his first year at home in Portland with his mom, who also worked remotely. Corona Solis remembers August through September fondly, majorly due to the comfortable Portland weather; but he said after Halloween when colder temperatures and rainfall passed through, he barely left the house. Once, he finished all eight seasons of “Game of Thrones” in a week.\n\n\n\n“I don’t really think about that a lot, to be honest, because there was nothing to think about,” Corona Solis said. “I was just doing class.”\n\n\n\nGillen said her mom would joke that Gillen attended college at “Occidental College – Newton Campus” (as in Newton, MA, her hometown).\n\n\n\nAhn lived in a two-bedroom apartment at the time and said his mom set up another desk in her bedroom for him to attend Zoom classes as he and his sister, who was attending Cal State Long Beach, had overlapping schedules.\n\n\n\n“Sometimes I would have to stay up late doing homework until midnight, and she would be there like, ‘Kyle take as much time as you want, I’m gonna go to bed but you stay here,’” Ahn said. “I had a corner of the apartment that was dedicated to my workspace, and that was all just because of the generosity of my mom. She was so instrumental in making sure I had at least a semblance of a productive workspace.”\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Gatewood said her parents and her brother decorated her room and bought a bookshelf and a desk to resemble the feeling of living in a dorm room.\n\n\n\n“I had my Zoom background, so I had specific posters that I wanted people to see in my background,” Gatewood said. “It wasn’t too bad, and I was really privileged in my situation.”\n\n\n\nWhile physical dorm rooms could be mimicked, the social aspects of being in a dorm were not so easily remedied.\n\n\n\nIglesias said she felt disconnected from Occidental.\n\n\n\n“I still felt like a high school student, just kind of like going through the motions. I was still in my childhood bedroom and I honestly didn’t even put in any effort to get to know anyone because it felt so awkward just to try to talk to people online,” Iglesias said. “It just felt so forced.”\n\n\n\nIglesias did, however, join the Dance Production Club (Dance Pro) because she danced throughout high school and wanted to continue the practice. Only this time, she was practicing in her attic.\n\n\n\n“It felt so silly,” Iglesias said. “You didn’t perform [the showcase] live over Zoom, you had to pre-record it on your phone and send a video of yourself, so obviously I was so hyper critical and I had like 20 videos of me doing the same dance over and over again on my camera roll. But it was cute, and it was funny doing Dance Pro the next year seeing people who were in my online dance group and being like, ‘I know you.’”\n\n\n\nBansiya also did Dance Pro online and said it was part of her first-year initiative to join as many clubs as she could to be as active as possible. One of those clubs was the Pulse Dance Club, which she is one of the presidents of.\n\n\n\n“If I came to campus freshman year, I don’t know if I would’ve joined Pulse e-board,” Bansiya said. “I think, for me, I was trying to be really active freshman year and that really helped push me into the things I do today.”\n\n\n\nFor others, the opposite happened. Gatewood, a lifelong volleyball player and a budding recruit for Occidental’s volleyball team, spent the first year experimenting with spending time away from the sport while still meeting with the team over Zoom.\n\n\n\n“When everything shut down, I was so happy because volleyball had to stop. I loved the sport, but it was just so nice to take a break for those two weeks,” Gatewood said. “Then, during that year when we were online, I was able to get in touch with my body in other ways that wasn’t volleyball and I was able to build my identity outside of being an athlete and a student athlete.”\n\n\n\nThen, there was that other part of college — class, or something similar to it.\n\n\n\nNoel Lee said she took a sculpting class and received paper clay, tape, molding tools and knives in the mail. Benyam-Desbel took a geology lab and opened a package full of quartz and slate.\n\n\n\n“We were depleting the art department’s funds, basically,” Noel Lee joked. “It was very fun. The professor couldn’t help us physically, so we were really trying hard to bring the sculpture up to the camera, like, ‘Am I doing this right?’ But it was nice to do hands-on activities and have my room to do all the crafts.”\n\n\n\nBansiya participated in Occidental’s Immersive Semester, a curricular program that started during the pandemic, which sought to connect students by keeping them together in clusters of academic courses and internship programs centered around a binding theme. The Fall 2020 semester offered “ PPE Portrait Project, Arts in Los Angeles”, “Computing IRL” and “California Environment & Conservation Corps.”\n\n\n\nBansiya said the program changed the trajectory of her Occidental experience.\n\n\n\n“I met some of my really good friends through the Immersive Semester because you just had the same three classes with them every day, and so eventually everyone got tight,” Bansiya said.\n\n\n\nChristensen was one of the Associated Students of Occidental College (ASOC) first-year class senators, which was a challenge in itself, she said, as she represented a student body she had never met in person and were all attending a school she had never really been to herself.\n\n\n\n“That was something I really wanted to try and honestly in some way I was worried I wouldn’t have tried it otherwise in person — I would’ve just gotten too nervous around everyone,” Christensen said. “But, I was like, ‘Well this is one way I can try and make the best of it and try something I always wanted to get into.’”\n\n\n\nChristensen said that she and the other ASOC senator were primarily focused on getting a pulse on how the class of 2024 was doing with bi-weekly check-ins rather than massive Zoom meetings because of complicated time zone limitations.\n\n\n\n“It was definitely difficult because it’s hard to try and reach out to a student body that’s so disconnected at this point, especially because all of us were new — we didn’t know each other, we were trying to get to know one another, the school, the upperclassmen. So, I think for all of us, we were just disoriented,” Christensen said.\n\n\n\nThe check-in forms reflected this feeling, Christensen said.\n\n\n\n“A lot of students felt like it was hard to connect and be involved because we didn’t know each other, it was hard for us to talk to each other because everyone was isolated,” Christensen said. “Mental health was also a big focus, which is understandable — there’s a lot of impact on the psyche after being isolated for so long.”\n\n\n\nElam sent a Spring update email November 2020 to the campus community stating that the college’s remote instruction would remain until further notice but kept the possibility of returning to in-person later in the semester open. In February 2021, Elam said the remainder of the Spring semester would also be completed online.\n\n\n\nBut by then, some first years were craving some semblance of independence and a college experience that they already moved to California with familiar faces and names from their first semester online.\n\n\n\nGillen moved to Glendale and lived in the Hyatt Place Glendale with about eight other students.\n\n\n\nGillen posted in the Occidental class of 2024 Facebook Group to gauge interest if anyone else was interested in moving to LA with her. After receiving a few responses, a parent found out that hotels around colleges were making deals with college students to let them live in a hotel room for the same cost as an apartment.\n\n\n\n“The Hyatt reserved one of the big meeting rooms for us to have for the whole semester so we could do all our classes there together, but I think classes were just so on the back burner and, where we were in Glendale, we had such easy access to the Americana and the Galleria and were just running around all the time.”\n\n\n\nLife at the Hyatt included cleaning service once a week and storing Trader Joe’s groceries in the hotel kitchen.\n\n\n\nGillen and her friends would go to Occidental to get COVID-19 tested every week and would sometimes meander into parties on off-campus houses with other students.\n\n\n\n“Looking back, I’m so grateful to have done that because not only do I feel like it gave me the college experience more and I got to live in LA for a semester — and it was so fun — but the friends I made doing that are some of my closest friends I have at Oxy.”\n\n\n\nFurther North, Bansiya and her friends from the Immersive Semester moved to her friend’s cabin in Lake Tahoe. And yes, they went skiing every weekend.\n\n\n\n“We barely left, like we couldn’t just go on a walk to a coffee shop. We were mostly just with ourselves, which I think now would have driven me insane, but I think back then, because we were at home so much, I think it was totally okay,” Bansiya said. “There would be days where I would go three or four days without leaving the house, but I think we were just so used to being home and being in a closed space it just felt normal.”\n\n\n\nChristensen also moved in with her fellow senator she met in the Fall semester in Pasadena, which was fun, she said, but moving did not mean negating the COVID-19 protocols she experienced back home.\n\n\n\n“I really tried to be diligent about that stuff, but it was a lot of again, waking up, going to my desk to do class, making food,” Christensen said. “It was a lot of very similar things, but just in a different place and on my own. I did like the being on my own part because it gave me some semblance of a transition and I’m not just under my parents’ roof.”\n\n\n\nWhen their sophomore year did come around, however, the class of 2024 was thrown into the first-year experience they did not have. Fernandez said it felt like there were two first-year classes that year.\n\n\n\nCorona Solis said meeting people in person for the first time after knowing them online was a weird experience.\n\n\n\n“At the first time it’s like, ‘Oh, I’ve seen you so many times,’ but this big,” Corona-Solis said, squeezing his thumb and index finger together. “A lot of my teammates [on the cross country team] were a lot shorter than I thought they would be.”\n\n\n\nNoel Lee said while she was excited to be immersed in a college setting, a lot of social interactions were anxiety-provoking.\n\n\n\n“I’m the kind who hates ordering food at a restaurant, and now I have to be present and take care of myself, figure out where the MP is, figure out what am I going to say, figure out where my class is, figure out how to participate,” Noel Lee said. “But seeing how everyone was in the same shoes really made me feel reassured. And everyone was really willing to reach out and get to know people and how they were all saving up their social energy for a year and now expressing that, I was like, ‘Okay, I think I have that energy saved up too, and I’m ready to use it finally.’”\n\n\n\nDaniel Lee said he was terrified to come to Occidental in person as a sophomore.\n\n\n\n“As much as I did a lot of socializing during the online year, it was a lot of virtual, not in person. So coming back to Oxy, all these people I don’t know, I have to interact with them, make new friends, I’ve got to balance social life on top of academics on top of doing stuff that I liked — it was just like a lot,” Daniel Lee said. “The first semester, I kind of took a back seat a bit. It was a lot of just going to classes, going to my room, just because I didn’t know a lot of people, I didn’t meet a lot of people. The biggest thing for me back then was eating alone, it was like the scariest thing ever.”\n\n\n\nFernandez said being masked while meeting people was an extra barrier to forming relationships while already feeling overwhelmed by being at an in-person college.\n\n\n\n“It was hard to make friends in the post-Zoom world,” Fernandez said. “I feel like were all traumatized and we didn’t know how to talk about it at the time, so we were just trying to live in the moment without being able to express our griefs about our hopes and fears — it was hard to make yourself vulnerable again and you just want to play it off like nothing really is wrong, so ready for college; but I feel like we all needed time to regain our sense of self and find joy and life again.”\n\n\n\nDespite the challenge, Fernandez said being in-person sophomore year was a welcome change. Benyam-Desbel said his sophomore year was amazing. He arrived to LAX by himself without knowing anybody and said many generous strangers helped him, and his four bags, get to campus.\n\n\n\n“Things just felt like they were falling into place really well, I was just happy to be here,” Benyam-Desbel said. “I was really happy to explore, everything was so new.”\n\n\n\nBenyam-Desbel also said the fact that the majority of Norris Hall was filled with randomly grouped sophomores sharing common rooms and suite-style living helped him feel comfortable quickly.\n\n\n\n“Everyone who lived in Norris that year was really happy to live in Norris,” Bentyam Dejbel said. “We just had such close friend groups built-in and places we could hang out.”\n\n\n\nBenyam-Desbel said there was also a mad dash to find friend groups fast upon arriving on campus sophomore year.\n\n\n\n“Everyone was kind of getting to try and know each other really fast and trying to quickly build these relationships because I think there was a kind of FOMO there because we didn’t get to do that for so long,” Benyam-Desbel said.\n\n\n\nChristensen said while she was excited to be on campus as a student, she also took on the role of ASOC’s director of Academic Affairs her sophomore year, which was challenging due to the loss of institutional knowledge of not only the student body but any momentum that had been building in ASOC previously.\n\n\n\n“No one knew anything, but also no one knew where to look,” Christensen said.\n\n\n\nGatewood said as a sophomore, despite feeling like she grew individually as a person and a student in her first year, she outgrew the desire to play volleyball in college.\n\n\n\n“Before COVID, this whole time, I was a student athlete, but now I just got to experience one year of just being a student and I really enjoyed it and so coming back sophomore year having to transition back to being a student athlete was really tough,” Gatewood said.\n\n\n\nGatewood eventually quit volleyball her sophomore year, she said, but the extra free time gave her more space to take classes she enjoyed and appreciated being on campus.\n\n\n\nGiving up hopeful endeavors was a feat faced by many seniors, including Iglesias, who said that she chose not to study abroad because she wanted to take advantage of being at Occidental, rather than somewhere else.\n\n\n\n“I could have studied abroad if I wanted to, but in my head, I was like, ‘At the end of the day, I already lost a year, might as well stay on campus and just enjoy it while I’m here,’” Iglesias said.\n\n\n\nHowever, the year online did not deter Christensen, Fernandez, Noel Lee and Daniel Lee from studying abroad. Christensen, who studied abroad in Tunisia and completed the UN semester in New York, said that having only completed four semesters on campus at Occidental, she sees her time off-campus as taking advantage of the college’s resources, rather than its actual campus.\n\n\n\n“I was like, ‘Why do you want to come here? You want to come here because you want to experience everything the school has to offer you, and part of that includes access to these incredible programs,’” Christensen said. “It was one of the best decisions I made, going abroad.”\n\n\n\nStill, reminders of lost time persist, especially for cross country and long-distance runner Gillen who said that in her junior year, she broke into the Top 10 times in Oxy history. Now in her senior year, she feels like she is just untapped potential as an athlete.\n\n\n\n“I feel kind of frustrated now because I had this breakthrough in the Spring, but it’s like what if I had a whole other year ahead of me to keep doing this? And so now in my senior Spring, I feel this pressure within myself to be like. ‘I need to do everything in my power to reach my full potential in the next few months because I don’t have more time after this,’” Gillen said.\n\n\n\nNow a month out from graduating as a college senior, Ahn said he would not do a single thing differently — except join Dance Pro earlier.\n\n\n\n“I thought I did enough to get myself out there, to put myself into very foreign circles of hobbies and social circles, I thought I did enough, but even in my senior year, I was like, ‘No, I could have done more,’” Ahn said. “I realized there’s not really a level where I could say that’s enough because you could always do more.”\n\n\n\nUnlike classes past, the seniors are leaving the college with a stronger sense of themselves, partly because that’s who they were stuck with for a full year.\n\n\n\nBenyam-Desbel said being by himself for so long made him appreciate being with people.\n\n\n\n“Having this traumatic experience that we went through together definitely strengthened relationships in really interesting and unique ways,” Benyam-Desbel said. “That’s all to say that I’m leaving Oxy with a lot of great friends. Since we were isolated for so long, it just made me appreciate all these things so much more. I remember walking down York in the three-hour break between classes and just thinking, ‘What a cool thing to be able to do.’”\n\n\n\nFernandez said while she wishes she had more opportunities to get to know her class, she said experiencing college in this way taught her to make do with what she has.\n\n\n\n“Looking back on [the online year], it showed us things that we needed to slow down and take things day by day and really appreciate the people in our lives,” Fernandez said. “I think it made me grateful for what I have.”\n\n\n\nGatewood said that the last four years have taught her that college comes in all shapes and timeframes. Normalizing that, she said, has deconstructed the mainstream idea that college must be a straight four-year attendance at one institution.\n\n\n\n“PSA to everyone to stay in the moment and be grateful for the time we have here,” Gatewood said. “I’m really grateful for the time I had here.”\n\n\n\nNoel Lee said she is proud of her college experience.\n\n\n\n“I had a list of things I wanted to do during college, which was studying abroad and all that stuff, and I did it, and I was really proud,” Noel Lee said. “[The online year] was a rough year. It made me more resilient to new, chaotic circumstances and it helped me find resources, find a way to resolve conflict and acknowledge my weakness and get help and make things better.”\n\n\n\nThe class of 2024 is ready to graduate, to say the least. This time, without the cars.\n\n\n\nContact Mia Anzalone at anzalonem@oxy.edu\n\n\n\n*Noel Lee is an illustrator for The Occidental.
id6&&Inherited style: family heirlooms as fashion&&Eliza Bodden&&240410&&tag&&In a world full of fast fashion, family heirlooms inspire one to look beyond the next season and to the next century, redefining what “trendy” looks like. Occidental College students discuss what their family heirlooms mean to them, including how the items are a source of connection and memory.\n\n\n\nLeila Anzalone\n\n\n\nLeila Anzalone (senior) has many pieces of jewelry from her grandmother and great-grandmother. These items include strands of pearls, an emerald bracelet, a ring stop, gold earrings and a jade stone necklace with a pendant of the Royal Hawaiian Crest. Anzalone said wearing these heirlooms reminds her of home.\n\n\n\n“[Wearing the jewelry] has to do with just being appreciative of [family members] and being reminded of them,” Anzalone said.\n\n\n\nAnzalone said these jewelry items have much more than just material significance. According to Anzalone, since much of her jewelry is traditional Hawaiian jewelry, it connects her to her culture, as well as her family.\n\n\n\nAnzalone said she remembers the first time she saw all of her grandmother’s jewelry and would go through her grandmother’s jewelry box growing up. Anzalone said this was a way for her to bond with her grandmother and that she has many positive memories of trying on the jewelry with her twin sister, Mia Anzalone*.\n\n\n\n“All of [the jewelry pieces] carry some sort of memory in them, so when I wear them, I feel really proud,” Anzalone said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Anzalone, a large part of her love for fashion comes from her grandmothers and that that most of her jewelry comes from her family.\n\n\n\n“When it’s based on lineage, it has more of that significance because it carries a lot more history and meaning,” Anzalone said.\n\n\n\nGenevieve Morel\n\n\n\nGenevieve Morel (first year) has one of their grandparents’ class rings and a variety of jewelry gifted to them by their mother and grandmother. Morel said the jewelry’s backstory and family history give them a sense of pride when they wear them.\n\n\n\nAccording to Morel, she is able to invent a new way of styling these pieces that carries on her mother and grandmother’s legacy while appreciating the jewelry in a new way.\n\n\n\n“I think that giving it a new life is really important, especially because sometimes heirlooms get kind of forgotten or kept very locked away,” Morel said. “I feel like wearing them is very important.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Morel, fashion has been a way for them to connect with their mother and bond. They said that starting from a young age, they have gone through their mother’s jewelry box while sitting in their mother’s art studio.\n\n\n\n“I look at something that I have seen a million times, but I see it in a new way and I can appreciate it, and that is just me stepping into myself more and expanding my taste,” Morel said. “I think that I have used jewelry kind of as a timeless continuity through my fashion.”\n\n\n\nFashion, heirlooms, shopping and sharing clothes with her mother, Morel said, have been a source of healing for both of them. She said she has fostered a deep connection to fashion as a way of expressing herself, even if it does not align with the ‘beauty standard’ or what others are wearing.\n\n\n\n“Showing [my mother] through the pieces she gives me… I can wear them outwardly and essentially be flashy and be super maximalist and loud,” Morel said. “[It] is demonstrating how I can take up space.”\n\n\n\nClaire Wilson-Black\n\n\n\nClaire Wilson-Black (sophomore) was gifted her grandmother’s class ring from when she graduated high school in 1954. She said she was gifted this ring by her grandfather after her grandmother passed away, because he wanted to give it to someone who would cherish it. According to Wilson-Black, this ring keeps the memory of her grandmother alive and allows her to carry a piece of her grandmother into her adult life.\n\n\n\n“I feel like when I wear [the ring] I have a sense of pride, but also it’s a piece that is important for memory too, because it can be easy to feel like your memory of someone is fading,” Wilson-Black said. “You have a physical thing that encapsulates who they were, what they meant to you, or what you meant to them.”\n\n\n\nWilson-Black said being able to wear an heirloom has changed her perspective on fashion, making her more conscious of her own self-expression.\n\n\n\n“Wearing an heirloom, I think it kind of directs and guides the way you think about fashion, because if fashion is about self-expression, it’s really cool to have a piece that incorporates your family into your self-expression,” Wilson-Black said.\n\n\n\nRebeca Garnica\n\n\n\nRebeca Garnica (first year) said she has multiple heirlooms from her family home in Guatemala, including pieces that used to belong to her mother and grandmother. She said she feels a sense of pride when she wears these pieces because they connect her to her country.\n\n\n\n“Being able to wear something that represents the beauty of my country always makes me proud,” Garnica said.\n\n\n\nGarnica said it is important to her that all the heirlooms were made in Guatemala and that they hold more significance since they are unique to her and her family.\n\n\n\n“This jewelry is from before the time of mass consumerism and mass production, so I know that the [jewelry] I am wearing is one of a kind,” Garnica said.\n\n\n\nGarnica said fashion has been a way for her to bond with her mother and two sisters. She said she hopes more people ask their family members about the stories behind their heirlooms because they represent family history.\n\n\n\n“I want people to be more curious about their families because it is your identity,” Garnica said. “Your background is something that you can’t deny. It is inherently a part of yourself.”\n\n\n\nContact Eliza Bodden at bodden@oxy.edu\n\n\n\n*Mia Anzalone works for The Occidental
id7&&Outside Occidental: Gamble House showcases Craftsman-style architecture, preserves the artistic identity of Southern California&&Noah Kim&&240410&&tag&&In March of 1908, ground was broken at 4 Westmoreland Place, Pasadena, CA, to begin construction on a house for the Gamble family, of the cleaning goods company Procter & Gamble.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, the house was completed, and it still stands in the same location today. Its façade is wide and layered. Plants and overgrown moss rise up around the dark, tiled, exterior walls, which are framed by brown wooden planks. The roof hangs low, casting its shade on the windows.\n\n\n\nOver a century has passed. The Gambles have since sold the house and moved out. But the building has been preserved in its original 1910 state — now a museum called “Gamble House.” Its main exhibition is the house’s elaborate architecture, designed by a pair of architect brothers, Charles Greene and Henry Greene.\n\n\n\nAlexandra Rasic, the Gamble House Conservancy’s executive director, said the Greenes’ meticulous attention to detail set the Gamble House apart from other houses as a work of fine art.\n\n\n\n“One of our taglines is ‘Architecture as a Fine Art,’” Rasic said. “And you really feel that when you’re in the house because of how thoughtfully it’s put together and presented.”\n\n\n\nThe rooms inside feature many wooden walls and frames. Rasic said the Greenes’ artistic personality is reflected in the choice and placement of these wooden elements.\n\n\n\n“You see the artistic display in the frieze that goes around the room that’s carved in redwood,” Rasic said. “[They’re] pieces of wood chosen for how expressive they are.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Rasic, the Greenes carefully designed every angle of the house to impress a feeling of comfort upon viewers.\n\n\n\n“[It] all looks so soft and warm and inviting,” Rasic said. “You can see from the edges, the finger-lap joinery, how soft it is. You see that everywhere. These plugs going into the staircase — the softness is throughout the house.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Rasic, even the accessories of the house — from the lamps and furniture to the stained glass and elaborate rugs — were part of the Greenes’ comprehensive artistic vision for the house.\n\n\n\nOutside, the house has a front yard, back yard and back terrace with a pond, which Rasic said was carefully designed by the Greenes to feel rustic and natural.\n\n\n\n“[It was] made to look like it was 100 years old the day it was finished,” Rasic said. “Great use of these clinker bricks, over-fired bricks intentionally, to add that kind of character.”\n\n\n\nOccidental College Art and Art History professor Sami Siegelbaum said via email that the Greenes were inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, an artistic movement at the turn of the 20th century that reacted to the trends of the Industrial Revolution. According to Siegelbaum, the Arts and Crafts movement emphasized the craftsmanship of art and design over the era’s obsession with technology and industry.\n\n\n\n“The [Arts and Crafts] movement wanted to return to an earlier era in which art, design, decoration, architecture were all produced by skilled craftsmen who possessed a deep knowledge of materials and aesthetic form,” Siegelbaum said via email.\n\n\n\nAccording to Rasic, the Gamble House has many features of Craftsman-style architecture, which was inspired by the movement. One of these features, Rasic said, is the house’s wide layout.\n\n\n\n“Arts and Crafts architecture is very horizontal,” Rasic said.\n\n\n\nThe Gambles’, who commissioned the design, and the Greenes’ shared fascination with nature is a theme of the house, according to Rasic.\n\n\n\n“It looks very organic when you’re standing outside in some places, with beautiful creeping figs that go around the building,” Rasic said. “It looks almost at times that the house was growing out of the ground like it’s one with the place.”\n\n\n\nDirector of Collections & Interpretation at the Gamble House Conservancy Jennifer Trotoux said one of the Gamble House’s most impressive features is its organization.\n\n\n\n“There’s that really natural flow through the main hall to all the other rooms,” Trotoux said. “And then the way that it relates, not only from room to room, but also to the surroundings. The way that everything is stacked so that you get those views to the north of the mountain, and those views to the west of the Arroyo Seco.”\n\n\n\nThe pièce de résistance of the Gamble House, Trotoux said, is its staircase, which is typical to any house designed by the Greenes.\n\n\n\n“The staircase railing steps follow the line of the stairs,” Trotoux said. “[It’s] made out of a single piece of teak that’s carved into that step shape.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Trotoux, outside of the Arts and Crafts movement, the Greenes’ architectural style was influenced by their West Virginia farm upbringing, as well as by various movements worldwide, including Asian styles.\n\n\n\n“They were really absorbing things from a lot of different sources,” Trotoux said. “They were at MIT, so to be put in that high-level educational environment, all of a sudden, after coming from the Midwestern city and farm, and the opportunities that they had there and the things they were exposed to [were influential]. They [were] in Boston [and] they [were] exposed to lots of Asian art.”\n\n\n\nAs part of this heterogeneous influence, Trotoux said the Gamble House was partly designed with a German concept of artistic cohesion.\n\n\n\n“The word is ‘gesamtkunstwerk,’” Trotoux said. “It’s not something that looks collected from a lot of different places, but it’s something where everything goes together.”\n\n\n\nTrotoux said the Greenes’ own architectural style was integral in creating an architectural identity for the Southern California area, especially with their unique use of wooden materials.\n\n\n\n“This style worked for Southern California and for the landscape of Pasadena,” Trotoux said. “[It’s] that idea of the West Coast being built on wood in the 20th-century and wood being such an important material coming down from the Northwest.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Trotoux, the Gamble House is a founding landmark in the history of LA architecture.\n\n\n\n“There’s a canon of great houses of the Los Angeles area,” Trotoux said. “And the Gamble House is usually considered to be the earliest in that canon of 20th-century architecture.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Siegelbaum, market trends today have largely commercialized the construction of buildings.\n\n\n\n“Art and architecture today, at least in places like the U.S., are more determined than ever by market forces,” Siegelbaum said. “What this has meant over the past few decades is that [buildings] are treated as speculative financial assets.”\n\n\n\nTrotoux said these trends have forced the hand of an architect out of the construction of many new buildings today, creating a commercial and impersonal relationship between a building and its inhabitants.\n\n\n\n“A lot of architects grumble that they were written out of the picture because people realized that they could just build something [that] didn’t matter,” Trotoux said. “There’s no priority placed on what architecture brings in terms of added value.

id8&&Lessons Learned: College may not have been the ‘best four years’ of my life, but it forged me into a warrior&&Mali Abel&&240410&&tag&&They say college is supposed to be the best four years of your life. As a 17-year-old who was having a hard time in high school because of severe mental health issues, I felt hope.\n\n\n\nFour years later, I ask myself, who actually believes that? To think this is as good as it gets? College was not the best four years of my life, and that’s OK. Instead, it became the foundation of the best that is yet to come.\n\n\n\nOccidental was my early decision school. I was certain that the grass here was undoubtedly greener than in New York. Right away, I felt drawn to Oxy’s community and the warm weather. Nonetheless I learned that no matter the distance, you can never take the New Yorker out of me. I quickly found myself longing to be back in New York.\n\n\n\nI applied to Oxy with this naive confidence I would find my people. My experience here differs from that of my peers. Interpersonal skills have never come naturally to me, and that made college tough for me. I was so quick to act on Oxy that I always asked myself, “Did I pick the right school?” I have concluded that there will never be a straightforward answer to this question.\n\n\n\nI spent my first semester attending classes from my childhood bedroom. My scheduled afternoon classes felt like night classes, with the time difference. It got to where some of my days ended at 9:00 p.m. Between online classes and being a part of the Associated Students of Occidental College (ASOC) as a first-year class senator, blue-light glasses became necessary to survive my first year at Occidental.\n\n\n\nMy time at ASOC was short-lived, as I lost the passion and sense of community I felt during my first year, a common theme I later discovered was part of my Oxy experience. Feeling desperate for closeness, I joined a sorority in my second year, only for it to disband in early February. At that point, all I had to look forward to was studying abroad in the fall.\n\n\n\nI never saw this as Oxy’s fault or anything Oxy, as an institution, did wrong. To feel isolated and on the outside looking in, I wondered if this was self-sabotage and that I would never find a community.\n\n\n\nAfter returning from the high of being abroad in Rome, Italy, adjusting to life in America was more challenging for me than I thought. Still, I had to be optimistic. Coming from the other side of the country had its perks. I gained a sense of independence and felt confident enough to study abroad. I was comfortable being alone, making eating at the Branca patio or going to flea markets with myself as company less of a burden. Nevertheless, I felt myself isolating in my single room at Erdman, buying more yarn to crochet with instead of making plans to see friends. I did not want people to see me eat alone, so I often skipped meals at the Marketplace.\n\n\n\nI joined The Occidental during my spring semester of junior year as a last resort to save myself from what felt like rock bottom. I knew nothing about journalism, but wanted to revive my love for photography. I already knew two people that were heavily involved at the paper, and they encouraged me to give it a shot as a staff photographer. At the end of the year, I realized that this was the community I longed for — found in the least expected place and least expected time I thought possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI always look back on my first year, wondering what having friends online meant and why they all left when we started school in person. But life is not a choose-your-own-adventure that you can restart, learning about every possible outcome. And if I had never come to Oxy, I would have never met the people I’m friends with, whether they are still in my life or are now strangers.\n\n\n\nCollege was a time of growth, and I learned to give myself more credit for getting through my first year in a pandemic and finishing with a newfound hope different from what I felt after getting accepted into college. I learned that trusting your intuition is vital regarding the classes you like and the peers you gravitate towards. And yes, the imposter syndrome fades as you become an upperclassman.\n\n\n\nNow, less than two months out from leaving Occidental and entering graduate school at Teachers College, Columbia University, I realized I can never truly leave New York. However, choosing a school closer to home would have been the safe route that would not have led me to where I am now.\n\n\n\nI can’t help but think of where I started as an 18-year-old, collecting crystals in her room with a freshly shaved head, not knowing if I would ever set foot on campus because of the pandemic — now, I know I found everything I was looking for.\n\n\n\nContact Mali Abel at mabel@oxy.edu
id9&&In loving memory: Robert Torres&&Sebastian Lechner&&240410&&tag&&I don’t exactly remember meeting Robert Torres. But during my first summer on campus and my sophomore year — a difficult time — I quickly came to learn that, if I walked into the Tiger Cooler around 4 p.m., there was a man behind the counter who would look at me and ask how I was doing. Not that many people actually looked at me at the time, or so it felt — I felt lost a lot of the time. As I ordered my Chai latte and took a slice of pizza, we’d chat about coming back from the pandemic, what his work was like, how class was going — everything and anything. Going to the Cooler to say “hi” became a daily ritual, and Robert was always sweet and caring. I made a friend.\n\n\n\nThe way he spoke and acted reminded me of my father. It was nice seeing someone else who was Latino on campus. By meeting Robert, in a lot of ways, I no longer felt alone. Sophomore year ended. Things would be okay.\n\n\n\nWhen I returned just a few weeks later for summer research, Robert was nowhere to be found. May 17, 2022, Robert died in a motorcycle accident. Of course, I’d read the email from President Harry Elam before returning to campus but I’d refused to believe it. I was certain he’d be there. I echoed a similar statement writing to a friend that summer: “The truth is I haven’t processed it even a smidge. I remember reading the email and being like, ‘Yeah, that’s another guy, not Robert. It’s not Robert.’ I am in complete denial about it.” Now, two years later, I still miss Robert. I am now graduating, and as I end my journey here, I realize I started it with Robert.\n\n\n\nRobert, the assistant director of dining services, worked for Occidental for 15 years. According to the email sent by President Elam, he arrived at the college after working at Mt. Saint Mary’s as a temporary catering manager before being hired as a full-time employee. In 2012 he was promoted to assistant director for catering until he was again promoted in 2017 to assistant director of dining services.\n\n\n\n“Robert genuinely believed in Oxy and worked for the College with pride and conviction. He brought a caring personal touch to his work,” Elam said via email. “With his vibrant personality and infectious smile, Robert made people feel at ease.”\n\n\n\nRobert is survived by his partner Sandra Saavedra and his four daughters, Jennifer, Kathy, Marisol and Tamara, along with four grandchildren.\n\n\n\n“He was very proud to work where he did and I think it shows,” Tamara Torres said. “My dad had a special gift for making everyone feel like such an important person.”\n\n\n\nKathy Torres is currently stationed as a master sergeant in San Antonio, Texas, with her two children. Tamara Torres resides in South Carolina, with her son, Robert, who she named after her father. Marisol Torres lies in Puerto Rico where she runs a small home remodeling business with her husband, while Jennifer Torres is an optometrist office manager in South Carolina. According to Tamara Torres, Robert was from Santurce, Puerto Rico, and moved to California as an adult.\n\n\n\n“Everything I do, I want to be like him,” Tamara Torres said. “Everything he did, he did with so much pride, and love and laughter. That’s who he was.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Kathy Torres, Robert valued education, and working at Occidental combined his passion for education, creativity and the culinary arts.\n\n\n\n“He loved working at Oxy,” Tamara Torres said. “He would have the hat on when he would come visit us. He would FaceTime and show me around. He knew everybody and he loved everybody.”\n\n\n\nRobert’s partner Saavedra supervises the front-of-house and cashier staff at Oxy, and can often be found at the Marketplace. Saavedra said that Robert was extremely passionate about his job and would focus especially on his relationships with coworkers and students. According to Saavedra, Robert would jump in to help any situation he could, from reducing the lines in the Marketplace to putting on an apron to wash dishes. Saavedra said that he made everyone want to feel at home.\n\n\n\nRobert’s legacy can be felt all throughout Occidental, not just in the people. According to Amos Himmelstein, the Distinguished Newcomer Award was renamed the Robert Torres Distinguished Newcomer Award in his honor. This award is given in Robert’s name to a staff member or admin based on their performance in their first one to three years working at the College.\n\n\n\nAccording to Saavedra, Robert interviewed her for the job — but their relationship budded two and a half years after working together. Saavedra said that throughout their nine–year relationship, she and Robert often worked side by side.\n\n\n\n“We met here, we worked together, we did everything together.” Saavedra said. “I worked with him, and we worked together for the events.”\n\n\n\nSaavedra also said Robert knew that working together was the start of something more.\n\n\n\n“When he interviewed me, I left the dining hall and went downstairs. He was with another coworker, and from the windows he looked down and told that coworker, ‘You see that woman right there? She’s going to be my wife.’” Saavedra said. “He felt it from the beginning.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Saavedra, their wedding was planned for the same year Robert passed.\n\n\n\n“He is the love of my life,” Saavedra said. “He is still in my life.”\n\n\n\nContact Sebastian Lechner at slechner@oxy.edu
