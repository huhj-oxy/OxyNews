id1&&Oxy SJP and Oxy JVP stage encampment for Palestine, plan to stay ‘as long as possible’&&Ava Lalonde&&240430&&test, exam, final&&April 29, 4 a.m., Occidental Students for Justice in Palestine (Oxy SJP) and Occidental Jewish Voice for Peace (Oxy JVP) assembled an encampment of 17 tents on the Academic Quad, below the steps of the Arthur G. Coons Administrative Building, to show solidarity with Palestinians against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the conflict in Gaza. Oxy SJP announced the encampment on their Instagram around 7 a.m., encouraging people to join. By 3:15 p.m., the encampment had grown to 38 tents. Oxy SJP spokesperson Matthew Vickers (junior) said that there were roughly 40 people at the encampment all day, with a peak of 70-80 people midday. Vickers, who was featured on the April 29 episode of NPR’s “Consider This,” said the timeline for the encampment is indefinite and the plan is to stay as long as possible. According to a banner at the encampment site, the encampment has three demands for Occidental’s administration — recognition of the Israeli occupation of Gaza as a genocide and a call for a ceasefire, full amnesty for all students and faculty protesting for Palestine and disclosure and divestment from companies Lockheed Martin, Elbit, Boeing and Caterpillar. According to Vickers, Oxy SJP delivered a memorandum titled “Divestment Proposal for Consideration of the Financial Committee of the Board of Trustees” to Occidental’s Chief Operating Officer Amos Himmelstein April 25. The memorandum discusses Boeing, Elbit, Lockheed Martin and Caterpillar’s “involvement and direct ties to war crimes against civilians,” asks the college to investigate if it is invested in these companies and, if so, to divest from them. After 4 p.m. April 29, the Oxy SJP executive board received an email from the Board of Trustees Investment Committee (IC) Chair, Ronald Hahn, responding to their divestment proposal. According to Hahn’s email, the college’s investment advisor confirmed that the college is invested in all four companies through several third-party mutual fund managers. “Virtually all of College’s investment assets (the Fund) are managed by third parties who manage pooled funds for the benefit of a number of investors, and, within their own investment guidelines, individual managers have significant discretion regarding how funds under their management are invested,” Hahn said via email to the SJP. According to Hahn’s email, the IC will “convene to review the proposal and make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees regarding SJP’s proposal to cease any future investment in these companies. The Board of Trustees will then vote on the IC’s recommendation at their next scheduled meeting before issuing a formal statement.” According to Vickers, the next Board of Trustees meeting is scheduled for the Fall, but Oxy SJP is hoping to convene an emergency meeting before then to hold a vote on divestment. Vickers said that the encampment is meant to highlight and center Gaza. “A lot of the coverage about the student movement has sadly overshadowed some of the most egregious things that happened so far in the war, such as the discovery of 300 bodies at Nasser […] Hospital,” Vickers said. In response to the encampment, President Harry Elam sent out a campus-wide email at 11:54 a.m., stating that any dialogue or demonstration should remain safe and peaceful. “One of Occidental’s highest purposes is to empower our community to learn to engage in society and advocate for their positions in a manner that moves difficult dialogues forward, regardless of the issue,” Elam wrote. The encampment hosted programming events throughout the day, including teach-in demonstrations from community organizations such as Queers for Palestine, Labor for Palestine and others focused on genocide and interrelated topics, Vickers said. A participant in the encampment who has attended previous Oxy SJP events said they had been at the encampment all day, only leaving to attend class. The participant, who will remain anonymous to protect their identity, said that their professors were supportive of the encampment and dismissed them from class early. “It is really scary how much the U.S. contributes to the genocide in Gaza and how much repression students have been facing recently for speaking out and for protesting,” the participant said. “Showing that we have each other’s backs and that we’re going to support especially our Muslim and Palestinian students on campus is really important to me.” The participant said they were planning to sleep over at the encampment. According to the participant, the encampment’s goal is to tell the college that its investments do not align with the core values of the college or its student body. The participant said that demonstrators have been participating in a variety of activities throughout the day. “That’s a pretty dominant narrative,” the participant said. “That these on-campus student protests are hateful or antisemitic in some way, and that’s really unfair to all of the Jewish students that are out here today, leading and supporting.” This is a continuing story and The Occidental will continue to report online.

id2&&Oxy SJP holds Tax Day walkout and demonstration, continues calls for administrative action&&Avinash Iyer&&240423&&poc,english&&April 15, Occidental Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) held a walkout and march to protest against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and the conflict in Gaza.  A spokesperson for Oxy SJP said the event was spurred by a call to strike from the Palestinian Youth Movement, a transnational youth organization for Palestinian liberation from Israeli rule.  April 15 is Tax Day in the U.S., the final date to file tax returns. The Oxy SJP spokesperson also said holding the event on Tax Day was an intentional choice to protest against the American government funding that seems to prolong the conflict.  “We chose the day also, symbolically, because it’s Tax Day,” the Oxy SJP spokesperson said. “Seventy percent of the arms to Israel, billions of dollars [are] flowing to the country thanks to US taxpayers.”  The walkout and march started around 11:30 a.m. on the steps leading to the Arthur G. Coons Administrative Center. A crowd of a little more than 40 students began gathering by the side entrance of Johnson Hall. A long banner was placed on the steps listing the names of Palestinian children under 5 years old killed by recent bombing in Gaza. By 11:50 a.m., a little more than 60 students had assembled by the steps.  At 11:55 a.m., an Oxy SJP member spoke to a crowd of what became around 80 students and faculty members.  In their speech, the Oxy SJP speaker said the conflict has now reached genocidal levels.  “Today is a literal representation of funding of the Palestinian genocide,” Oxy SJP speaker said.  The speaker said that Oxy SJP is continuing to call for Occidental to divest from companies associated with the Israeli state. According to them, Occidental has a history of divestment from companies on ethical and environmental grounds.  “In 2012 to 2014, Oxy’s Board of Trustees divested from military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines after the Sandy Hook massacre,” the Oxy SJP Speaker said. “Two years ago in 2022, Oxy divested and promised not to invest in fossil fuels.”  However, the Oxy SJP speaker said that when it comes to companies tied to the Israeli state, Occidental seems resistant and even hostile to calls for divestment.  “In 2019, when SJP, along with faculty, students and staff, demanded that Oxy’s Board of Trustees divest from companies that funded the state of Israel, not only did the Board of Trustees reject this divestment attempt, but SJP members were doxxed for this action,” the Oxy SJP speaker said.  Occidental College’s director of communications, Rachael Warecki, said via email that the College gave Oxy SJP formal procedures for proposing divestment following Oxy SJP’s overnight occupation of the AGC back in November.  “The College has a process through which student, faculty, or staff groups can submit proposals related to the College’s investment practices,” Warecki said. “Following the campus political activity earlier this academic year, that process was shared with students from the Occidental SJP chapter.”  However, she said that the administration has not received any new formal divestment requests since its earlier discussion with Oxy SJP but is open to providing answers on how to formally proceed with a request.  “Since then, the College has not received a proposal on this topic,” Warecki said. “Administrators have made themselves available to answer any questions that student groups may have about the process, and will continue to do so.”  The Oxy SJP speaker said this resistance is indicative of an immoral apathy toward certain minority interests.  “It tells us that when it comes to Black and Indigenous Palestinian lives, Oxy refuses to acknowledge their humanity and continues in apartheid and genocide and is more than complicit in murdering innocent people of color,” the Oxy SJP speaker said. “That’s shameful.”  According to the Oxy SJP speaker, the event is a part of the broader student activist movement for Palestinian independence that is being suppressed. They said nearby developments at Pomona College are exemplifying this suppression.  “Look at Pomona College and [Pomona College President] Gabi Starr arresting 20 students by riot gear who are occupying and demanding divestment from genocide,” the Oxy SJP speaker said.  The Oxy SJP speaker said that the movement advocates for the Palestinian cause regardless and that the walkout and march continue the call for ceasefire and divestment.  “In spite of all of this, we students speak for ourselves,” the Oxy SJP speaker said. “We have to speak for ourselves against the silencing of pro-Palestinian movement for a ceasefire statement and for divestment.”  After their speech, the speaker led students on a march circling twice around the Academic Quad, with two students holding the flag of Palestine at the front. Students chanted slogans such as “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “Your profits are covered in Palestinian blood.”  After marching around the Academic Quad, the students walked inside the AGC, where two speakers from Stop LAPD Spying, an organization opposed to police surveillance, spoke to the crowd.  “History books will be written about what you all are doing here today,” the first Stop LAPD Spying speaker said. “And it’s scaring the s**t out of the people in power.”  According to the first Stop LAPD Spying speaker, both Democrats and Republicans have put forth bills aimed at shutting down pro-Palestine demonstrations, and demonstrations are often not supported by members of administrations.  “We see the way that the police are attacking SJP students in Claremont. We see the way that Canary Mission lists people’s faces, especially targeting Muslim, Black, Arab and other people of color youth to try to make them unemployable,” the first Stop LAPD Spying speaker said.  The first Stop LAPD Spying speaker said that they are opposed to the concept of a two-state solution.  “F**k all that, what we have to do is get rid of Zionism,” the first Stop LAPD Spying speaker said. “We know that Zionism is not just an issue that is important to people in Palestine; it’s integrally tied to all the white supremacist policing here.”  According to the second speaker, the struggle for Palestine and Stop LAPD Spying’s opposition to police surveillance are the same battle.  “We’re not merely here as supporters, right? We are involved in the same quest for liberation,” the second Stop LAPD Spying speaker said.  At around 12:10 p.m., the second speaker led students on a closing chant denouncing what they see as white supremacism ingrained in institutional forces of government: “LAPD, KKK, IDF, they’re all the same.” The event ended by 12:20 p.m., as students cheered and dispersed from the AGC.

id3&&Indigo De Souza headlines SpringFest, closing out Spirit Week&&Nora Youngelson&&2404234&&math,science&&Strobe lights illuminated Rush Gymnasium April 13 as three acts took the stage for the annual Springfest. This year the headliner was Indigo De Souza — an Indie Rock artist — and the show featured two student openers: Alyssa Player (senior), with her accompanying band, and the Indie band Spirit Foul.\n\n\n\nDe Souza performed an arrangement of songs from her albums “I Love My Mom” and “All of This Will End.” She also played two unreleased songs for the crowd of students.\n\n\n\nOccidental Programming Board Co-Managers Sophie Weil (junior) and Teo Lennertz (junior) said that their team has been planning SpringFest since the early Fall semester. According to Programming Board’s club advisor Steve Eulenberg, the choice for this year’s headliner was made by the student community.\n\n\n\n“I had the students reach out and do a survey of the community to find specific artists that they were looking for,” Eulenberg said. “With that data, I helped the students go through and identify both artists that were recommended and were requested while also looking at genres.”\n\n\n\nWith the survey information, Weil said the team landed on De Souza, the 26-year-old artist from North Carolina.\n\n\n\nIn addition to SpringFest, Lennertz said that Programming Board wanted to do something a little different this year, so they decided to create Spirit Week.\n\n\n\n“This is our first Spirit Week ever,” Lennertz said. “Every day from Monday to Friday leading up to SpringFest we have partnered with a different organization or [have] hosted an event ourselves. We wanted to make SpringFest an even bigger event than it has been in previous years, especially since we haven’t had FallFest this year. We really wanted to make this whole week something special for the school.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Eulenberg, Spirit Week included events such as a magic show, an open mic night and a DJ set of student artists. Eulenberg said that he hoped this week would contribute to the campus community.\n\n\n\n“I am hoping to build school spirit and tradition, I think that is really important,” Eulenberg said. “And then working with the larger LA music scene and being able to provide students with an experience here on campus that’s kind of reflective of the robust music scene here in LA.”\n\n\n\nWeil said that Occidental’s community comes together around music, and it was important to Programming Board that student artists open for De Souza.\n\n\n\n“It is a really big deal for the student bands to open and have that opportunity,” Weil said. “They get really excited, and that also draws [in] a bunch of their friends who are excited. We really want to keep supporting the student musicians here as much as possible, especially since the music community here has grown so much recently.”\n\n\n\nAccording to Weil, Programming Board chose the two openers, Alyssa Player and Spirit Foul, after receiving submissions from many student artists.\n\n\n\nSpirit Foul guitarist Eli Kramer (junior) said that it was an amazing experience for the band to be able to open at SpringFest.\n\n\n\n“It was fun because a lot of us hadn’t played on a pro set up before,” Kramer said. “So it was fun to get a chance to hear ourselves with professional sound. And we practiced a lot more than normal, so the couple of weeks before we were gearing up and that was a lot of fun.”\n\n\n\nWeil said that Programming Board intended to host SpringFest in Remsen Bird Hillside Theater. Due to forecasted rain, however, the Programming Board announced via email April 11 that SpringFest would be moved to Rush Gymnasium. Rush Gymnasium was then quickly converted into a stage, complete with lighting and free refreshments provided by Yerba Mate.\n\n\n\n“Honestly, the space was cool,” Kramer said. “I think they did a good job of making the gym feel like a different space.”\n\n\n\nWith the basketball nets lifted up to make room for the stage, Player opened up the night with originals from her album “Ice Cream Trucks,” supported by band members Lucas Donovan (junior), Matan Birnbaum (junior) and Luca Nisimblat (sophomore).\n\n\n\nFollowing Player, Spirit Foul — a band made up of students Kramer, Lily Pesikoff (sophomore), Nate Pitroff (sophomore) and Soren Covell (sophomore) — played mostly originals, alternating between main vocalists.\n\n\n\nAfter the student openers, headliner De Souza took the stage, playing many of her top hits. During her song “Younger & Dumber,” the audience took out their phone flashlights.\n\n\n\nAccording to Weil, at the end of the day SpringFest is an event for the students, and the Programming Board wanted to create an event that reflected and uplifted the campus community.\n\n\n\n“SpringFest is a super communal, fun and different event,” Weil said. “Every year we are able to make the choice of keeping it free for all the students. That’s a big thing that we will keep doing just to be able to give access to the community.”\n\n\n\nContact Nora Youngelson at youngelson@oxy.edu.
